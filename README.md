# OctoPrint-Filetypes

This plugin lets you control which file extensions are allowed to be uploaded thru the 'Upload' and 'Upload to SD' buttons.

If you have installed plugins that support additional file types, add them to the list so that you can easily upload them.

**Note:** The server will still reject uploads for unsupported file types. Only add extensions that are supported by your installed plugins.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/kforth/OctoPrint-Filetypes/archive/master.zip
    
Retart the instance after installing.

## Configuration

Go to 'Settings' -> 'Filetypes Plugin' and configure the extensions you need.
